# My Emacs Package Management

This directory contains the packages that are downloaded and installed
by the built-in package manager (via `package-install`). Its contents
are ignored and can vary slightly between installs. I'd rather not
commit the contents of this directory because I don't know if these
files can include any sensitive information.
