One of the many heralds of geekdom is an extremely customized
environment. This is the history of my journey down that path.

I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and
[Z-Shell](http://www.zsh.org/) as my primary tools for getting things
done. I track my code with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (though I do have
some older projects using [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)).
Much of that code is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/).
